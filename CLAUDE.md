# Claude Instructions

## Project Type
Web application (React / Vue / Angular).

## Package Manager
Use whatever package manager is already configured in the project (check for lockfiles: `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `bun.lockb`, `yarn.lock`, `package-lock.json`). Do not mix package managers within a project.

## Code Style
- Follow existing conventions in the file being edited — match indentation, quote style, and semicolon usage
- Do not add comments or docstrings to code you did not write or significantly modify
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Keep changes minimal and focused — do not refactor or clean up surrounding code unless explicitly asked

## Testing
- Run tests after completing any non-trivial change
- Fix all test failures before marking a task done
- Do not mark a task complete if tests are failing or the build is broken

## Git & Commits
- Never commit without explicit user instruction ("commit this", "create a commit")
- Never use `--no-verify`, `--force`, or skip hooks without explicit user permission
- Always stage specific files rather than `git add -A` or `git add .`
- Prefer creating new commits over amending, unless the user explicitly asks to amend

## General Rules
- Ask before taking any irreversible or broadly-scoped action
- Do not install new dependencies without checking with the user first
- Do not add features, error handling, or abstractions beyond what is directly requested

## Workflow Orchestration

### 1. Plan Node Default
- Enter plan mode for ANY non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions)
- If something goes sideways, STOP and re-plan immediately — don't keep pushing
- Use plan mode for verification steps, not just building
- Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity

### 2. Subagent Strategy
- Use subagents liberally to keep the main context window clean
- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents
- For complex problems, throw more compute at it via subagents
- One task per subagent for focused execution

### 3. Self-Improvement Loop
- After ANY correction from the user: update `tasks/lessons.md` with the pattern
- Write rules that prevent the same mistake from recurring
- Ruthlessly iterate on these lessons until mistake rate drops
- Review lessons at session start for relevant context

### 4. Verification Before Done
- Never mark a task complete without proving it works
- Diff behavior between main and your changes when relevant
- Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"
- Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness

### 5. Demand Elegance (Balanced)
- For non-trivial changes: pause and ask "is there a more elegant way?"
- If a fix feels hacky: implement the elegant solution instead
- Skip this for simple, obvious fixes — don't over-engineer
- Challenge your own work before presenting it

### 6. Autonomous Bug Fixing
- When given a bug report: just fix it — no hand-holding needed
- Point at logs, errors, failing tests — then resolve them
- Zero context switching required from the user
- Go fix failing CI tests without being told how

## Task Management
1. **Plan First** — Write plan to `tasks/todo.md` with checkable items
2. **Verify Plan** — Check in before starting implementation
3. **Track Progress** — Mark items complete as you go
4. **Explain Changes** — High-level summary at each step
5. **Document Results** — Add a review section to `tasks/todo.md`
6. **Capture Lessons** — Update `tasks/lessons.md` after any correction

---

## Core Principles
- **Simplicity First** — Make every change as simple as possible. Minimize code impact.
- **No Laziness** — Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards.
- **Minimal Impact** — Touch only what's necessary. Avoid introducing new bugs.
